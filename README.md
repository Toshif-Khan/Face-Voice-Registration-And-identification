# Face-and-voice-registration-and-indentification.

It is a full project of two level authentication with speak guidance. In this project we can register a face and voice of a new user and as well can identify face and voice also.

First of all when user came to us we will open a web cam then capture speak user to capture his/her face, after capturing image we have two option 

1) Either he/she already registered his/her face or 
2) The user is new(not registered yet) for us.

If he/she already registered his/her face then we will go for voice identification after voice identification we will match both face and voice identity, if we found same identity then we allow his/her to access his/her transaction otherwise we request user to give the same voice identity as face identity.

If user is not registered yet then we will redirect user to registeration for his/her face and voice. Here we request user to enter his/her name then we will create his/her profile in our database(AccountDetails). After that we will request user to capture his/her photo which is clear and should be with proper face rectangle, user need to be capture atleast three photos and then we will register these photos with out person group. Then after we will request user to record his/her voice for voice registeration. Here we recommand user to speak clearly atleast 5 second or more. After all this things happened, Now user is ready to use his/her face and voice for next time transaction process.

This is all.
